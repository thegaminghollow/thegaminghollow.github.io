After formatting the SD card rename it to something other than wiiu as it will not allow you to jailbreak your console if it it names wiiu.\nGetting The Files For The SD Card To make the process of jailbreaking your console easier we have compiled everything you need to jailbreak your console into a single .zip file which can be downloade HERE. after you have downloaded the zip file extract it and copy the enclosed folder to your desktop (the folder should be named wiiu-sd-card-compilation) now open the folder named wiiu-sd-card-compilation, select all the files inside it and drag them onto your SD card.\nJailbreaking the Console Eject the SD card from your computer and insert the SD card into the Wii U’s SD card slot. Now turn on your Wii U and open the internet browser and go to wiiuexploit.xyz then once on the page click run homebrew launcher and hold the X button until a screen says Environment Loader at the top.
